# Elements
Technical Test for iOS Developer position

This project is using Xcode 6.2
I've use: 
  • Alamofire for getting the data (https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)

  • SwiftCSVReader for parse de information https://github.com/peterentwistle/SwiftCSVReader
  
  • Hanake Framework for image cache (https://github.com/Haneke/HanekeSwift)

I'm using cocoapods for manage Alamofire library, so you may need to run "pod install" in your computer to make it work

If there is any problem with the app just send me your UDID and I will send you and invitation for tesflight

Kind regards
